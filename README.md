# R3VAMP
R3VAMP (Revamp):an innov-a-thon, a platform for innovation, optimization and remixing of <br/>
old technologies & re-vamping them in a more modern/usable/secure way. In this day & age <br />
when a lot of legacy software solutions are still around we invite you to make the lives better <br />
by evolving the system & forging it for the better.

# Examples
1. Take any legacy website & revamp it into a scalable microservice that runs on containers. <br />
2. Find a faster file copy solution (Hint: Windows devs may leverage BITS for this). <br />
3. Take any legacy application & port it into either a mobile or UWP application <br />
4. Re-design a popular website.

# Guidelines
1. Themes will be given one day before the event. <br />
2. A time-slice of 5 hours will be provided to work on the solution. <br />
3. All the participants have to bring their own laptops. <br />
4. Decisions of judges will be final & binding. <br />
5. Along with the development of solution the team must write a report stating the changes <br />
and how their version of the product/service is going to help make things better. <br />
6. Code submission must be in the form of github link. <br />

# Rules
1. Use of internet is allowed. <br />
2. Max team size must NOT exceed 4 students. <br />
3. Cross college teams ARE allowed. <br />
4. Developed solution must be usable in some-way which will be decided by judges. <br />
5. Rest of the rules (if any) will be instructed on the spot.

# Note
1. The judgement panel reserves all rights for disqualification of any team or participant <br />
at any point of time if they find any of the above rules are broken or any unfair means in the play are found. <br />
2. It'll be the responsbility of the participants to keep themselves updated since the organizers <br />
reserve rights of modification in rules or guidelines or the format of event at any point of time. <br />
Although, efforts will be made to keep the participants in the loop.
